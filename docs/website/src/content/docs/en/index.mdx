## Why Starter Gradle?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Centralized Build Logic" icon="setting">
    Manage all your convention plugins in one place with `build-logic`. No more copy-pasting Gradle configurations across modules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-language Support" icon="open-book">
    First-class support for **Kotlin**, **Java**, and **Spring Boot** with pre-configured modules and convention plugins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Quality Standards" icon="approve-check">
    Integrated static analysis with **Detekt**, **SpotBugs**, and **PMD**. Automated formatting with **Spotless** keeps your code consistent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modern Tooling" icon="rocket">
    Uses **Gradle Version Catalogs**, **Configuration Cache**, and keeps dependencies up-to-date with best practices.
  </Card>
